# Spot_jumping

This is the code for my final project for Underactuated Robotics at MIT.

It is a kino-dynamic jump optimization for Spot written in Drake. It solves for Spot's foot positions and forces which will be fed to a whole body controller.

I plan to keep working on this. Right now it only plays back Spot's state trajectory that the optimization returns.

Here are some videos:
